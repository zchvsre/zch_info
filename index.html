    <p>Hi! You've reached Zhou's website.</p>

    <p>I am a physicist in training at UC Santa Cruz interested in the nature of dark matter. I am trying to tackle the
        question with data from wide and deep-field surveys, predictions from theory and simulations, and tools from
        artificial intelligence and statistics. </p>

    <p>See my CV <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zchvsre/curriculum_vitae/main/cv_8.pdf"> here</a>.</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------</p>
    My academic journey started at the University of Washington where I studied philosophy and classics for two years.
    Then I moved to Duke where I studied physics, mathematics, and the history of economic thought for another two
    years.
    Now I am a graduate student in the Physics Department at UC Santa Cruz.
    <p>-----------------------------------</p>
    <p>My last name is Zhou 周 and my first name is Conghao 丛浩. I go by my last name Zhou, which is pronounced like "Joe"
        but in a different tone. If there is another Zhou in the room who also goes by their last name, I go by C.H.
        Zhou.</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------</p>
    <p>Thanks to my fantastic mentors, I am now convinced I can also be a good physicist if I put in the work. I would
        like to pass on the help, the kindness, and the encouragement I received and still am receiving. Through
        mentoring and outreach, I am trying my best to convince younger generations that, no matter who they are and
        what their past experience with physics is, they have the potential to do great physics.</p>
    <p>-----------------------------------</p>
    <p>My broader academic interests include history and philosophy of science, continental philosophy, and visual
        culture. </p>
    <p>-----------------------------------</p>
    <p>I worked as a journalism intern, a videographer, and a marketing assistant at various times in my life when I was
        away from physics. </p>
